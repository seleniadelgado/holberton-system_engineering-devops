12) Script that prints the type of the file named iamafile. The file iamafile will be in the /tmp directory when we will run your script.
13) Symbolic link to /bin/ls, named __ls__. The symbolic link should be created in the current working directory.

15) Create a script that moves all files beginning with an uppercase letter to the directory /tmp/u. You can assume that the directory /tmp/u will exist when we will run your script.
16) Script that deletes all files in the current working directory that end with the character ~.
17) Script that creates the directories welcome/, welcome/to/ and welcome/to/holberton in the current directory.
